class EconomyGamma(BaseTriggerModel):
    """
    A highly performing non-myopic trigger model based on the economy architecture for early time series classification.
    Allows the anticipation of future decision costs based on a supervised grouping of time series and user-defined
    costs for delay and misclassification. Trigger models aim to determine the best time to trigger a decision given
    evolving time series. Can be used in junction with a Chronological Classifier object for early classification tasks.
    Introduced in paper [1].

    Parameters:
        cost_matrices: numpy.ndarray
            Array of matrices of shape (T, Y, Y) where T is the number of considered timestamps/measurements and Y is
            the number of classes, representing the cost of misclassifying a time series at each time step. For each
            matrix, a value at coordinates [i,j] represents the cost of predicting class j when the actual class is i.
            Usually, diagonals of the matrices are all zeros, and the costs between each matrix should globally
            increase. These costs should be defined by the domain expert.
            The function "create_cost_matrices" can be used to obtain these matrices from a single misclassification
            matrix, a function that outputs the cost of delay given the number of measurements in a time series and
            the set of timestamps.
        models_input_lengths: numpy.ndarray
            Input lengths considered by the trigger model. The time series' number of measurements for which a
            transition matrix and confusion matrix and thresholds are computed. These lengths should be the same as the
            ones used to train the chronological classifiers.
        nb_intervals: int, default=5
            Number of groups to aggregate the training time series into for each input length during the learning of the
            trigger model. The optimal value of this hyperparameter may depend on the task.
        aggregation_function: function/string. default='max'
            Function to aggregate the probabilities of each class for each time series prediction in the multiclass
            case to create the intervals thresholds. Known aggregation functions are listed in the
            'KNOWN_AGGREGATIONS' constant.
            See paper [2] for more detail.

    Attributes:
        thresholds: numpy.ndarray
            Array of shape (T, nb_intervals-1) where T is the number of input_lengths known by the trigger model.
            Thresholds correspond to the values between which the first class probability (or aggregated probabilities
            in the multiclass case) need to fall for a prediction to be aggregated to a certain group (interval).
            See paper [1] for more details.
        transition_matrices: numpy.ndarray
            Markov chain matrices of shape (T-1, nb_intervals, nb_intervals) where T is the number of input_lengths
            considered by the trigger model and where each row t contains the transition matrix of intervals from
            timestamp t to timestamp t+1.
            Each value [i,j] in the row t represents the probability for a time series to belonging to group j at t+1
            given that it belonged to group i at t.
            See paper [1] for more details.
        confusion_matrices: numpy.ndarray
            Array of shape (T, nb_intervals, Y, Y) where T is the number of input_lengths known by the trigger model and
            Y the number of classes. Contains for each input length the confusion matrix of the time series contained in
            each interval, with values [i, j] representing the probabilities of being classified in class j when the
            actual series' class is i.
        classes_: numpy.ndarray
            Array showing the names and order of classes, necessary to interpret the predictions contained in the
            training set.
        initial_cost: float
            Cost returned when trying to obtain the delay and misclassification cost associated to the prediction of a
            time series whose length is not known by the trigger model (not contained in 'models_input_lengths') and
            below that of the first known length.
            Returns 0 for the the delay_cost summed with the cost of predicting the class with the highest prior
            probability found during training.
        multiclass: boolean
            Boolean representing whether the problem is multiclass or not. Influences whether the aggregation functions
            will be used or not.
            See paper [2] for more detail.
